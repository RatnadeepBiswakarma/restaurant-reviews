# Front-End Restaurant Review Project by Ratnadeep

### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8080`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

1. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
2. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
3. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

#### note if you have different port no of localhost then change the port no according to your server port no in the file `dbhelper.js` near line no 11.
